At the core of any home automation system is an easy-to-use user interface.  In the center hallway of my house is my Arduino Thermostat and 24" touch panel.  This touch panel is connected to a Foxconn AMD "Book Computer" running Windows 8.1.  The program you see in the image below is my VB.Net application for user control.  This is basically a front-end user control program.  It interfaces with my backend systems using mostly RESTful APIs.  It's on my To-Do list to make this program use REST API interconnects exclusively.
