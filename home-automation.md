My first project when I was a freshman in college was to create a network-connected thermostat based on an Arduino.  The code was messy but I learned a lot about networking and automation in the process.  I have included my original iteration at the bottom of this page.  After I gained more experience I wanted a more flexible development platform and redid the project in Python using a Raspberry Pi.  
<h3>Current Design</h3>

I used a generic 8" touchscreen LCD panel in a 3D printed case as a display.  I wrote a dead simple GUI in Tkinter that was easy to operate using a touchscreen.  I stripped a lot of unrelated functionality from the GUI that was in my original iteration below as I realized it was much less confusing.  All of the functionality that is available in the GUI is also exposed as on a REST API.  I interface with the HVAC system using the same 8-channel relay board I used with the Arduino.
<h3>First Design</h3>
At the core of any home automation system is an easy-to-use user interface.  In the center hallway of my house is my Arduino Thermostat and 24" touch panel.  This touch panel is connected to a Foxconn AMD "Book Computer" running Windows 8.1.  The program you see in the image below is my VB.Net application for user control.  This is basically a front-end user control program.  It interfaces with my backend systems using mostly RESTful APIs.  It's on my To-Do list to make this program use REST API interconnects exclusively.
