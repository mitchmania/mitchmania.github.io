Hello, my name is Mitchell Artin and welcome to my computer science blog!  I have many hobbies from maintaining tropical aquariums to cycling but I am most passionate about computer science.  You can often find me hacking away at my own network infrastructure on many a late night.  During the day I'm studying computer science at the University of Florida and also working in their Network Administration department.  I'm constantly trying to expand my knowledge and share what I've learned along the way.  A self-acclaimed workaholic (I really enjoy what I do), I've worked at many other companies like Capital One, City of Ormond Beach IT, and Grassroots Motorsports.  I hope to use this website to share my experiences and knowledge to hopefully help and inspire others.
