Hello, my name is Mitchell Artin.  I am a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Florida.  I am currently working as a software development co-op engineer at [Planetary Resources](https://planetaryresources.com).  I am tasked with development of flight and ground software in Python to operate our Arkyd 6 spacecraft.  Arkyd 6 is a cubesat we are using as a testbed for the electronics and software we have developed in-house.  It is the most enjoyable work I have done thus far.  My software work on the SpaceX Hyperloop comes in at a close second.  I am actively seeking full-time job opportunities in the greater Seattle area after my graduation in May 2018.  You can view my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Resume_na_10_27_17.pdf).
