I currently use two Citrix Xenserver hosts for all of my virtualization needs.  However, I know Python so I am intrigued about what features OpenStack can bring to my network, specifically its Python APIs.  This week I have installed Ubuntu and DevStack on to a bare-metal host and am testing it out.  DevStack is an installer script to quickly set-up a simple OpenStack environment with basic settings for testing.  OpenStack is a hot topic in the industry right now so simply the experience will be invaluable.  Another cool project going on right now is called TryStack.  It allows you to get access to an OpenStack cluster for free that you can use for experimentation.  I will be reporting back my results soon.
