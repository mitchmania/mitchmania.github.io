My greatest passion is computer networking.  In my college home my collection of servers and networking equipment is always growing.  Living in a two bedroom house with a roommate and computers powering everything from lights to air-conditioning, it was getting sort of cramped.  So one day I decided I needed to kick my roommate out and turn his bedroom into an office.  This is a picture of my server rack in 2014.
